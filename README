Introduction
==============

NIX world offers so many options to store centrally managed user accounts.
One of them is SQL DB and associated mechanism libnss-mysql libpam-mysql. 
Lack of reasonable web based admins pushed me into searching if somebody has made django based admin of these entites.
There was some tries but none of them finished. Thats why this repository. 
For details see: http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/nss-mysql/sample.sql?root=nss-mysql&view=markup

User manipulation has some triggers to optionally perform some other activities.
I.e. samba user adding along sys user adding, home creating/removing.
For this is necessary to issue some commands on machine where these services are running.
Extra project has been extraced for this purpose: https://github.com/vencax/django-command-runner

Installation
==============

1. Clone the read-only repo

     git clone git@github.com:vencax/django-sql-nss-admin.git

2. Install the dependencies via PIP.

     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add nss_admin into your INSTALLED_APPS.

4. Include nss_admin.urls into your root url conf

     url(r'^nss_admin/', include('nss_admin.urls')),
     
5. Add sys_users database connection and router:
	
	DATABASES['sys_users'] = {
	  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
	  'NAME': 'yourDBName',

	  'PASSWORD': yoursecretpwd,
	  'HOST': 'yourDBHost',

	}

	DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['nss_admin.routers.SysAccountsRouter']
		
6. Optionaly add following configs into settings

	DEFAULT_SHELL = '/bin/bash' - default shell associated with a user 
	PGINA_HACKS = True	- if you plan use PGina for auth on Win machines (hack - see code ..)
	UID_RANGE_BEGIN = 5000 - begin of interval users ID taken from (prevent mangling with system account IDs) 
	GID_RANGE_BEGIN = 5000 - begin of interval groups ID taken from (prevent mangling with system groups IDs)
	
	plus few others (for details see. the code)
				
7. You are done
